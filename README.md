A custom implementation of a Linear Elastic Model and a 2nd Order Mooney-Rivlin Model are used to design a 1cm x 1cm printable elastomeric tactile sensor. 

Requires PyMesh and SFEpy to be installed (which will likely require linux and half a day), along with the usual gang of imports

Time Spent: About 5-6 weeks on this code, but I was learning on the job.

Outputs from this project would be injested into CURA to slice 3D prints, then used my own hardware to compare my models and reality. 

Also has a basic visualiser using the MayAVI package, which I was new to, but turned out well. (Im a seasoned MatPlotLibber)
