The Simulation.py script for SFEpy and PyMesh, making up the core of my dissertation simulation

Installation: 
It is expected that the installation of PyMesh and SFEpy has been completed already. Installation instructions for each may be found at thier own repositories. 

Passing all SFEpy tests is required for clean operation, therefore if you do not pass the tests then please do not expect this simulation to behave! 

Simulation.py should be placed in the SFEpy install folder and run from there. 


Any additional packages (numpy etc) are easy to acquire!
